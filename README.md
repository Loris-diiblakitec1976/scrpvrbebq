Just walked out of Cleaner, and honestly, I don't know what to think about it – or maybe I do and it's just a jumble of things, like that last dream before your alarm goes off. You know the kind where you wake up and wonder if you're still dreaming? Yeah, that's where I am right now.

So, let’s just get it out there: Samuel L. Jackson plays this ex-cop turned crime scene cleaner, and I guess I wasn’t expecting to feel like I needed a shower after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it. But here I am, mentally reaching for a loofah. The whole premise – he's mopping up gruesome murder scenes, right? It's weirdly engrossing in a should I look away now? kinda way, like when your cat’s doing that weird stretchy thing and you just can’t stop 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 even though you know it’s pointless.

And the characters. My god. They’ve got this grittiness to them that either makes you want to know everything about them or utterly avoid them in the aisle of the grocery store. Eva Mendes is in it, and she does that thing she does where she’s both there and not there, you know? One moment she’s driving the story, and then it’s like she just slipped through the 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬s of the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 and you’re left wondering if she’ll reappear like a forgotten side dish in the back of your fridge. 

> But here’s the thing: despite the heavy subject matter, it feels kinda light. Airy, maybe, like a soufflé that you didn’t expect to rise but did, and you’re left unsure if it’ll collapse the moment you touch it with a spoon. Do soufflés even go with murder mysteries? I guess they do now.

Actually, I think the whole   is like reading a thriller novel when you’re half asleep – you know something important is happening, but damn if you can piece it together with the brain fog. There’s this funny bit where a neighbor thinks there’s a “𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘬age” and I almost laughed out loud. Or maybe I did, I can’t remember. The  , though, ain't really there to make you laugh; it's more like it smacks a wet newspaper across your face and says, Here, deal with this.

Oh, and to top it off, there’s some low-key commentary on how we clean away our own messes, literal and metaphorical. I mean, do we? Or do we just make a bigger mess and hope someone like Jackson's character comes along? These are things you apparently ponder as you try to find your car in the parking lot, realizing you've walked the wrong way for the third time.

```python
def scrub_blood(scene):
    if guilt in scene:
        return spotless
    return stained_forever
```

Look, who am I kidding, this  's probably gonna end up in my weird favorites category. Like, am I gonna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮 it again? Maybe, yeah. Just to make sure I didn’t dream its wacky, unsettling existence. Nothing quite like curling up with a   that makes you unsure if you're the one who needs a life cleaner.
